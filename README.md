# Introduction
**Large language models (LLMs)** have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, achieving significant advancements in text comprehension, question answering, and content generation. However, their performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, particularly those requiring domain expertise, remains suboptimal due to the folllowing limitations: their pretrained knowledge, though broad, lacks depth in specialized areas due to reliance on general-domain data, resulting in inconsistencies with current domain standards; they struggle with precise, multi-step reasoning required by domain-specific rules, often failing to maintain logical consistency and accuracy in complex reasoning chains; and they exhibit limited context sensitivity, frequently misinterpreting or oversimplifying domain-specific terms and concepts that vary meaning based on context.

**Retrieval-Augmented generation (RAG)** offers a promising solution to customize LLMs for specific domains. Rather than retraining LLMs to incorporate updates, RAG enhances these models by leveraging external knowledge from text corpora without modifying their architecture or parameters. This approach enables LLMs to generate responses by leveraging not only their pre-trained knowledge but also real-time retrieved domain-specific information, thereby providing more accurate and reliable answers. However, the practical effectiveness of RAG systems in real-world applications is hindered by limitations in complex query comprehension, difficulties in synthesizing distributed domain knowledge, inherent constraints of LLMs, and issues with system efficiency and scalability[1].

To address these limitations, **graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG)** has recently emerged as a new paradigm to customize LLMs with well-organized background knowledge and improved contextual reasoning. GraphRAG, formally defined as a specialized subclass of the RAG framework, utilizes graph structures to systematically organize and retrieve domain-specific knowledge. Its workflow encompasses two key stages: offline indexing and online retrieval. The overall pipeline is as follows.
